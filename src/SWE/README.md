## 🔧 What is Software Engineering?

**Software Engineering** is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It aims to:

- Deliver high-quality software
- Within specified **time and budget constraints**
- By following **systematic processes**, **best practices**, and **industry standards**

------

## 🚀 What is a Software Development Methodology?

A **Software Development Methodology** is a structured approach to organizing and managing the process of software development. It defines:

- Phases of development
- Roles and responsibilities
- Tools, techniques, and deliverables

**Examples**: Agile, Waterfall, RUP, DevOps

-----------------------

## 🔄 What is the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)? Why is it Cyclical?

**SDLC** is a structured series of phases that guide the development of software systems:

1. Requirements Gathering
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

It is **cyclical** because after the product is deployed, it enters a **Maintenance phase** where:

- Bugs are fixed
- New features are added
- The software evolves continuously

This leads to new iterations of the cycle.

## 🛠️ 3 Software Development Methodologies – Strengths and Weaknesses

| Methodology                        | Strengths                                                    | Weaknesses                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Waterfall**                      | Simple, well-structured, good for fixed-scope projects       | Inflexible, high risk, late feedback, poor for changing requirements |
| **RUP (Rational Unified Process)** | Iterative, use-case-driven, encourages documentation         | Heavy on documentation, can be complex to manage             |
| **Agile**                          | Fast iterations, customer collaboration, frequent deliveries | Requires close communication, less predictable scope         |
| **DevOps**                         | High automation, continuous delivery, fast and reliable deployment | Requires mature infrastructure, steep learning curve         |



------

## ⚙️ What is Agile Software Development?

Agile is a **lightweight, iterative** approach to software development that emphasizes:

- **Customer collaboration**
- **Working software over documentation**
- **Responding to change**
- **Cross-functional teams**

Frameworks include **Scrum**, **XP (Extreme Programming)**, **Kanban**, etc.

------

## 🧪 What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a development practice where tests are written **before** code. The cycle is:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass the test
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

------

## 👨‍💻 What is XP (Extreme Programming)?

A set of engineering practices for **high-quality code and collaboration**, including:

- **Pair Programming**
- **TDD**
- **Continuous Integration**
- **Refactoring**
- **Small releases**
- **Collective ownership**

------

## 🌀 What is Scrum? How is it related to Agile?

**Scrum** is a popular Agile framework that structures work into **time-boxed Sprints** (typically 2–4 weeks). It promotes:

- Daily collaboration
- Regular delivery
- Inspect-and-adapt cycles

Scrum is one of the **implementations of Agile principles**.

------

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner** – defines and prioritizes the Product Backlog
- **Scrum Master** – facilitates the process, removes impediments
- **Developers** – implement the functionality
- Other roles (optional): **QA**, **Designers**, **DevOps**, **Architects**

------

## 🗃️ Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog** – full list of requirements
- **Sprint Backlog** – selected backlog items for current sprint
- **Increment** – working software at the end of sprint
- **Burndown Chart** – visual of work remaining
- **Task Board** – progress tracking (To Do, In Progress, Done)

------

## 🕒 Scrum Ceremonies (Events)

- **Sprint Planning** – define sprint goal and select backlog items
- **Daily Stand-up** – 15-minute team sync
- **Sprint Review** – demo of completed work to stakeholders
- **Sprint Retrospective** – internal team reflection to improve
- **Backlog Refinement** – update and reprioritize product backlog

------

## ⏱️ What is a Sprint? How long should it be?

A **Sprint** is a time-boxed iteration in Scrum (commonly 2 weeks) during which a **potentially shippable product increment** is developed. Sprint length can vary (1–4 weeks), but must be consistent.

------

## 📋 What is the Product Backlog?

A **prioritized list** of all desired product features and requirements, maintained by the **Product Owner**. It evolves as the product grows.

------

## 📌 What is the Sprint Backlog?

A **subset of the Product Backlog** selected for a specific Sprint, along with a plan for delivering the items and achieving the Sprint Goal.

------

## 🧾 How to Specify Software Requirements

- **Requirement Statements** – formal descriptions
- **Use Cases** – narrative description of functional behavior
- **User Stories** – Agile way to describe requirements from the user’s perspective:
   `"As a <user>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>"`

------

## ⚙️ What is a Use Case?

A **use case** describes an interaction between a **user (actor)** and the **system** to achieve a goal. Example:

- Actor: "Customer"
- Goal: "Place an order"

Use cases are typically represented with **diagrams** and **flows**.

------

## 🧑‍🏫 What is a User Story? How is it different?

A **User Story** is a lightweight, Agile-friendly requirement format:

> *"As a user, I want to log in so I can access my dashboard."*

**Differences**:

| Use Case                            | User Story                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Formal, structured                  | Informal, conversational       |
| Often includes flows and exceptions | Focused on user value          |
| Suitable for detailed requirements  | Ideal for incremental delivery |



------

## ⚠️ What is the Flat Backlog Trap?

Occurs when the **Product Backlog is too long, unorganized, and hard to prioritize**. Teams lose sight of high-value features.

### ✅ Solution:

Use a **User Story Map** to visually group and prioritize work based on **user journeys**.

------

## 🗺️ What is a User Story Map?

A **visual framework** that organizes user stories by **goals and activities**. Helps:

- Prioritize releases
- Identify MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Avoid flat backlog trap

------

## 🧭 Describe the Agile/Scrum Process

1. **Product Owner gathers requirements**
2. Creates and maintains **Product Backlog**
3. Sprint Planning: team selects items from backlog
4. **Sprint Execution** (1–4 weeks):
   - Daily Stand-ups
   - Continuous development and testing
5. Sprint Review: demonstrate to stakeholders
6. Sprint Retrospective: reflect and improve
7. Repeat

------

## 🔁 Sprint Review vs Sprint Retrospective

| Sprint Review               | Sprint Retrospective    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| With stakeholders           | Internal team only      |
| Demonstrates completed work | Reflects on process     |
| Focus: Product              | Focus: Team improvement |



------

## ❌ True or False: The Scrum Master is responsible for creating the Product Backlog

**False** – The **Product Owner** is responsible for the Product Backlog.

------

## 🎲 Technique for Estimating User Stories

- **Planning Poker** – team uses **story points** to estimate effort collaboratively using cards or a tool

------

## 🔁 RUP is Iterative – True or False?

**True** – Rational Unified Process is an **iterative** and **incremental** methodology.

------

## 🧱 What is Domain Modeling? What diagram is used?

In **Domain Modeling**, we create a **Domain Model Class Diagram** to represent:

- Key concepts
- Their attributes and behaviors
- Relationships between them

------

## 🧩 What is UML and why is it useful?

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** is a standardized way to:

- Visualize system architecture
- Communicate designs clearly
- Document software structure and behavior

Examples:

- **Class Diagram**
- **Use Case Diagram**
- **Sequence Diagram**
- **Activity Diagram**
