ISP Violation:

In the bad example, the AllInOneMachine interface is a "fat" interface. It includes methods for printing, scanning, faxing, and copying.

The SimplePrinter class only needs the print() method, but it is forced to implement scan(), fax(), and copy(), leading to UnsupportedOperationException or empty implementations. This indicates that SimplePrinter is dependent on methods it doesn't use.

Similarly, the FaxMachine class only needs fax(), but is forced to implement other unused methods.

This violation causes:

- Unnecessary Dependencies: SimplePrinter is tied to scanning, faxing, and copying, even though it doesn't do them.

- Broken Expectations: Clients using SimplePrinter might mistakenly try to call scan() due to the interface, leading to runtime errors.

- Maintenance Headaches: If the AllInOneMachine interface changes (e.g., a new laminate() method is added), all implementing classes, even those not doing lamination, would be forced to implement that new method.

Adhering to ISP (Good Example)

To adhere to ISP, we should break down the AllInOneMachine interface into smaller, more granular, role-specific interfaces.

__Adhering to ISP (Good Example)__

To adhere to ISP, we should break down the AllInOneMachine interface into smaller, more granular, role-specific interfaces.

In the good example:

- We've broken down AllInOneMachine into four distinct interfaces: Printer, Scanner, Faxer, and Copier.

- MySimplePrinter now only implements Printer, eliminating the need for dummy UnsupportedOperationException methods.

- MyFaxMachine only implements Faxer.

- A true MyAllInOneMachine can implement all four interfaces, indicating its full capabilities.

This design adheres to ISP because:

- __Clients depend only on what they use__: MySimplePrinter only "sees" the Printer interface, and it's not forced to know about scanning, faxing, or copying.

- __Reduced Impact of Change__: If a new feature like laminate() is introduced, it would be added as a new Laminator interface. Only machines capable of laminating would implement it; existing printers and fax machines remain unaffected.

- __Compile-time Safety__: The compiler will prevent you from accidentally calling scan() on a MySimplePrinter object because the method is not part of its implemented interface. This pushes errors to compile time rather than runtime.

ISP promotes highly cohesive and loosely coupled designs, leading to more robust, flexible, and maintainable software systems.
