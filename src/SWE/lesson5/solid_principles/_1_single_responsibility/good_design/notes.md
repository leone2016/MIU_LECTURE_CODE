In the good example, we have broken down the bad User class's responsibilities into separate, specialized classes:

* User: Solely responsible for holding user information. Its only reason to change would be if the structure of user data changes.

* UserRepository: Solely responsible for user persistence (saving and retrieving from a database). Its only reason to change would be if the persistence mechanism changes.

* EmailService: Solely responsible for sending emails. Its only reason to change would be if the email sending mechanism or content changes.

* UserAuthenticatorService: Solely responsible for authenticating users. Its only reason to change would be if the authentication logic changes.

This decomposition makes the code:

- __Easier to modify__: If we change the database type, only UserRepository needs modification.

- __Easier to test__: Each class can be tested independently.

- __More readable__: Each class's purpose is clear.

- __More reusable__: EmailService could be reused to send other types of emails, not just welcome emails.

By adhering to SRP, we create a more robust, maintainable, and flexible software design.
